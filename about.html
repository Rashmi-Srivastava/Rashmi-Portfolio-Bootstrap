        My name is Rashmi Srivastava. I completed my Graduation in B.Sc(bio)
        from MGKVP University, Varanasi in 2016, followed by a PGDCA Diploma in
        2017. After that, I dedicated some time to preparing for goverment
        exams. However, overtime, my interest has been shifted and I developed a
        keen Interest in web development. I've started learning HTML and CSS and
        I'm excited about building creative functional websites.
